    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>We started off just capturing the cats around our home and feeding them in colonies, trying our best to help humanly control the cat population. As others around us where just killing feral cats.  But we started to notice more and more cats from the colonies were going missing, so we decide to act protect the cats, and the wildlife around the cats. So, we made the choice that we would move them to a dedicated space. We started this move in early 2015, with our first enclosure. This enclosure was a little over a half an acre, where we moved out cats that where in the highest risk areas. For a time, we settled on just that half an acre enclosure as it was all our land could hold. During this time, we managed to get all the feral cats in our area spay or neutered. In 2017 we hit the milestone of no new kittens being born feral in our area. But, after one-to-many close calls with hurricanes we started to look for a place to relocate.</p>

    <p>In 2019 we picked up shop and moved to our current location. With our new location we had much more space to expand our space for our cats, and much safer weather. While the sanctuary isn’t full set up, yet we get closer and closer to having it fully up and running every day. Thanks in part to the great volunteers we have working every day. With the new space we have all sorts of exciting plans to make the life of our cats better than before. At the moment we have about one hundred cats that we car for. With plans of being able to care for at least two hundred cats. We can do this do to all the support that we get from our volunteers and donators. The best way to stay up to date with what is going on and to learn about future projects and work parties is to sign up to our newsletter to get monthly updates on what’s going on.</p>

    <p>Most of our cats started off life as cats that we trapped from around our home and fixed. As most of them will never be comfortable with living a domesticated life we try our best to make sure that they are provide for. We have a wide variety of cats that we care for, from your standard issue cat to a Bombay. We feed our cats 3 times a day, using lots of feeding stations that we built. For our cats that extra help when it comes to eating or medicant we feed those cats in our new closed off medical bay. The cats get yearly vet trips, with the cats that need the extra help going more often. They have lots of both shady spots to beat the heat, and nice sunny perches to lay back and sunbath. We also are growing long grasses for the cats to have more room to play.
